You are using the wrong jar or version of baritone, the wrong minecraft version, or you didn't install the correct AltoClef version. <br><br>

_It's possible that you installed a version of AltoClef that already includes Baritone. If this is the case, simply remove the Baritone JAR from your mods folder_<br><br>

(You can check if the AltoClef version you installed includes Baritone by opening the "altoclef" JAR file with WinRAR. Look for the "META-INF" folder and then go to "Jars." You should see a file named something like baritone-unoptimized-fabric-<MC VERSION>.jar. )
