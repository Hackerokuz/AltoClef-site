title: How do I edit Settings?
---

In your `.minecraft/altoclef` folder there should be a file called `altoclef_settings.json`.
Open it up and edit it. If you're not familiar with JSON and think you broke the settings, look up "Json Parser" and use it to make sure your edited settings are in a valid format.
